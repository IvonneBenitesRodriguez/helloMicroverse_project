  This project is about the usage and benefits of <strong>ESLint</strong>.<br/>
  ESLint is a static code analysis tool for finding errors, bugs, and stylistic errors.<br/>
  This provides the developer with the ease of delivering clean code.<br/>

    - [Key Features](#key-features):
    - The most important part is to add the specified folders and files for the configuration of ESLINT.<br/>
      Files like <strong>.gitignore </strong> or folders like <strong>.github/workflows</strong> are important to store<br/>
      important files like <strong>linters.yml</strong>, as well as <strong>files to be hidden </strong>like node_modules are placed<br/>
      inside the .gitignore file.<br/>
      Another important part is the creation of branches. Besides our <strong><em>main</em></strong> branch, I created a branch <br/>
      to develop the header which will be merged to the main branch.<br/>
